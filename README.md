# Hangman Game
Welcome to Xen's Hangman! This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. Try to guess the hidden word before making too many mistakes.

# How to play:
1. Run the script in Python.
2. You will be given a word to guess. The length of the word will be displayed.
3. You have a limited number of guesses (represented by the Hangman drawings).
4. Enter a letter as your guess.
5. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
6. If the letter is incorrect, a part of the Hangman figure will be drawn.
7. Continue guessing until you either complete the word or run out of guesses.
   
The Hangman drawings are represented in ASCII art

To customise your experience, you can add your own word files to the available_files list to create different difficulty levels.

# Future improvements: 
- Implement user input to select difficulty levels.
- Add different word files for various levels.
- Enhance the interactive output for a better gaming experience.
